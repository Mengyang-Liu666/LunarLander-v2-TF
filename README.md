# LunarLander-v2-TF
Solving LunarLander-v2 with Tabular, DQN and REINFORCE using TensorFlow
### Running Notebooks
*  Run the notebooks on Google Colab is recommended
*  IMPORTANT: please change the `notebook_path` in the initialization
section of all notebooks when running on Google Colab.
### File Descriptions
